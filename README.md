## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/vector-engineering/covidcg.git`

### Python

1. Get a conda distribution of python, we recommend [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   conda env create -n covidcg -f environment.yml
   ```

#### Data Requirements

Data processing is handled by a snakemake pipeline as defined in `Snakefile` in the project root. Input data is currently downloaded from a GISAID feed, where each isolate is a line of a serialized JSON object. The fields required for each isolate's JSON object are:

- sequence
- covv_virus_name
- covv_passage
- covv_gender
- covv_specimen
- covv_location
- covv_patient_age
- covv_seq_technology
- covv_lineage
- covv_patient_status
- covv_orig_lab
- covv_collection_date
- covv_accession_id
- covv_subm_lab
- covv_comment_type
- covv_clade
- covv_subm_date
- covv_host
- covv_authors
- covv_assembly_method

Instructions for processing data from another data source, such as in-house data, is coming soon.

### Javascript

This app was built from the [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) example app.

1. **Install [Node 8.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**

   Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor)** to assure hot reloading works properly.

4. Complete the steps below for your operating system:

   #### macOS

   - Install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) via `brew install watchman` to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/871) which occurs if your macOS has no appropriate file watching service installed.

   #### Linux

   - Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).

     `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

5. **Install NPM packages**

   `npm install`

6. **Run the example app**

   `npm start -s`

   This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

## Analysis Pipeline

Data analysis is run with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Python scripts, and bioinformatics tools such as `bowtie2`. Please ensure that the conda environment is configured correctly (See [Python](#Python)) and that all [data files](#Data-Requirements) are present and linked correctly to the `data/` folder.

Preview (dry-run) the pipeline by running:

```
snakemake -n
```

and run the pipeline with:

```
snakemake
```

**NOTE**: `bowtie2` usually uses anywhere from 8 – 10 GB of RAM per CPU during the alignment step. If the pipeline includes the alignment step, then only use as many cores as you have RAM / 10. i.e., if your machine has 128 GB RAM, then you can run at most 128 / 10 ~= 12 cores.

Contact the authors by email: [covidcg@broadinstitute.org](mailto:covidcg@broadinstitute.org)

Python/snakemake scripts were run and tested on MacOS 10.15.4 (8 threads, 16 GB RAM), Google Cloud Debian 10 (buster), (64 threads, 412 GB RAM), and Windows 10/Ubuntu 20.04 via. WSL2 (48 threads, 128 GB RAM)

## Data enabling COVID CG

We are extremely grateful to the [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/) and all its data contributors, i.e. the Authors from the Originating laboratories responsible for obtaining the speciments and the Submitting laboratories where genetic sequence data were generated and shared via the GISAID Initiative, on which this research is based.

## Citing COVID CG

Users are encouraged to share, download, and further analyze data from this site. Plots can be downloaded as PNG or SVG files, and the data powering the plots and tables can be downloaded as well. Please attribute any data/images to [covidcg.org](https://covidcg.org/).

Note: When using results from these analyses in your manuscript, ensure that you acknowledge the contributors of data, i.e. _We gratefully acknowledge all the Authors from the Originating laboratories responsible for obtaining the speciments and the Submitting laboratories where genetic sequence data were generated and shared via the GISAID Initiative, on which this research is based_.
