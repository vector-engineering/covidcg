    """Split up the data feed's individual objects into metadata and fasta files. Chunk the fasta files so that every day we only reprocess the subset of fasta files that have changed. The smaller the chunk size, the more efficient the updates, but the more files on the filesystem.
    On a 48-core workstation with 128 GB RAM, aligning 200 sequences takes about 10 minutes, and this is more acceptable than having to align 1000 sequences, which takes ~1 hour. We end up with hundreds of files, but the filesystem seems to be handling it well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_feed: str
        - Path to data feed csv file
    out_fasta: str
        - Path to fasta output directory
    out_metadata: str
        - Path to metadata.csv output file
    chunk_size: int
        - Number of records to hold in RAM before flushing to disk
    processes: int
        - Number of processes to spawn when writing to disk
