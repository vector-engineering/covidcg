We developed Covid-19 CG in 2020 as a resource for scientists responding to the pandemic. Since its launch, the browser has been used by numerous groups internationally to monitor diagnostic target sites and develop diagnostics for new variants, analyze mutations that may impact therapeutic antibodies or small molecules, understand the breadth of mutations in a genomic region of interest, track the emergence and frequency of mutations over time and in different locations, and follow global sequencing efforts. Five years on, our project has now concluded but could be restarted if we obtain future funding.
